## Face Detection Project with OpenCV and DNN

## Description

This project uses the OpenCV library together with a pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to detect faces in images. Face detection is a fundamental task in many applications such as security, photography and social networking. This software enables accurate and efficient face detection.

## Features

- Accurate face detection: Uses a pre-trained DNN model to achieve high accuracy in face detection.
- Support for local and online images**: You can process locally stored images or download and process images from URLs.
- Simple interface**: The code is easy to understand and modify, allowing it to be integrated into other projects.
